# What it does

With the coming of vercel came the coming of _far too many_ comments on every PR. This extension simply checkes every second at urls that match `"https://github.com/*/pull/*"` and clicks on all "Load more..." buttons if they exist. I haven't noticed any performace issues on PR's since having Chat GPT whip it up.

## Install
1. Clone repo
2. Go to Chrome extensions (chrome://extensions) in the url bar
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right of the screen
4. Click on "Load unpacked" in the top left and load the directory you cloned.
